    "\n",
    "a) Suppose if more edge costs are negative, the algorithm in terms of picking up the lowest cost to reach the goal will end up exploring all the edge paths(because the edge costs are less and high chances of forming a loop) which inturn ends up exploring the whole dataset to find the optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Yes this might help, but cannot be always helpful in finding the optimal path. An example can be of two paths from A to D through B and C respectively. All the edges will have positive costs except the edge C to D(-1). A to B(2), A to C(3), B to D(2). In this case, the search might lead to the case of choosing A-B-D as the path. But the shortest path can be A-C-D.\n",
    "Generally, if it's a tree, this will help on reaching the goal node taking the best path based on edge cost though its negative. But in graphs, this will however(whatsover the negative condition may be) will cause a looping unless there's an optimal path. Thus, it is not helpful in graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The agent stays in that loop until it finds an optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Visiting the same place for humans makes it seem boring and considered as a waste of time. This is the same case for state space search as well. It is better to mark a nodes as visited once it explores that specific node and avoid looping. This can be done by have a list/set noting down the visited nodes along with each traversal. \n",
    "\n",
    "e) For example, you think of taking a nap for 1 hour to get active(with 1 hour remaining work left and deadline in two hours) and end up sleeping for 10 hours missing the deadline."
